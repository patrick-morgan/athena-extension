    “(With) today’s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that
    fundamentally changed. For all practical purposes, there are virtually no
    limits on what the president can do. It’s a fundamentally new principle and
    it’s a dangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be
    constrained by the law even including the supreme court of the United
    States.”

    The notably political speech comes at a critical moment for Biden’s campaign
    as he tries to beat back persistent concerns about his age exacerbated by
    his performance in last week’s presidential debate. His unsteady performance
    wreaked anxiety among some of his top donors and raised uncomfortable
    questions for Democrats about whether he should remain on their ticket, much
    less serve another four years in the White House.

    During Monday’s speech, Biden appeared alert, reading energetically from a

    On Monday, Biden referenced the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US
    Capitol and called it “one of the darkest days in the history of America.”
    He said the court’s decision has made it unlikely that Trump will face trial
    for his criminal charges related to that riot before the election.

    The court’s decision technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to move
    forward with his election subversion case against Trump, but left many
    technical questions unresolved – making it increasingly unlikely that a
    trial can get underway before the November election. Smith’s case now
    returns to lower courts, which must review the specific steps Trump took to
    overturn the results of the 2020 election and whether those actions were
    official, and therefore receive immunity, or private, and do not.

    The majority said that Trump’s conversations with the Justice Department –
    his efforts to try to get officials on board with his attempt to overturn
    the election – were covered with absolute immunity. For other official
    actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there
    is at least some immunity and it largely deferred to lower courts to sort
    that out. That’s a process that could take weeks or even months.

    Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts
    cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could
    make it much harder for Smith to prevail. Chief Justice John Roberts also
    wrote that the lower courts may not consider a former president’s motive,
    which may allow Trump’s attorneys to argue that he wasn’t attempting to
    overturn an election in his favor at all.

    Biden, who has made protecting democracy a central tenet of his campaign,
    described the decision as a broader pattern from the Supreme Court in
